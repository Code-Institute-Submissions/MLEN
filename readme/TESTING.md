## Testing

- Tested HTML code via [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) There were errors showing the validator is unable to the javascript but it's not affecting the site.

- Tested CSS via [W3C CSS Validator Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and results show 1 error about appearance is not an textfield var but it's needed to hide the up and down button for input type number and it's not affecting the site. 

- Tested Javascript via [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) there were various warnings regards to the $ in jQuery. Searching has shown that some extra code should be added to the .jshintrc to remove these warnings but this is outwith my current knowledge and skill base.

- For the Python code, the cornflaked-linter(flake8) extension is installed in the development environment. This gave a live validation check for the code. There's warnings about line too long but I'm unsure how to resolve it.

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Firefox and there are no errors.
